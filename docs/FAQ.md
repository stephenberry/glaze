# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### What happens when the JSON input is missing objects? 

The input JSON can be partial. It could include a single value. Only what is included in the JSON will be changed. JSON pointer syntax is also supported, which can be used to change a single element in an array (not possible with normal JSON).

### How are unknown keys handled?

By default unknown keys are considered errors. A compile time switch will turn this off and just skip unknown keys:
`glz::read<glz::opts{.error_on_unknown_keys = false}>(...)`

### Can I specify default values?

Yes, whatever defaults are on your C++ structures will be the defaults of the JSON output.

```c++
struct my_struct {
   std::string my_string = "my default value";
};
```

### Do I need to specify the complete structure of the parsed JSON or just the parts Iâ€˜m interested in?

You only need to specify the portion that you want to be serialized. You can have whatever else in your struct and choose to not expose it (using `glz::meta`).

### Is the write/read API deterministic?

*If I parse and serialize the same JSON string multiple times, is the output guaranteed to be the same every time?*

Yes, Glaze is deterministic and can be round tripped, but in some cases C++ containers do not guarantee identical roundtrip behavior. Structs are compile time known, so they're deterministic.

You can use std::map and std::unordered_map containers with the library. If you choose the former the sequence is deterministic, but not the latter.

Floating point numbers use round-trippable algorithms.
